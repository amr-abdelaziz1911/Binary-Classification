## Objective
The goal of this project is to build a binary classification model using Keras to predict heart disease based on various health indicators. The model is trained to classify whether a person has heart disease or not, based on features from the dataset.

## Description
The dataset used is the Heart Disease Health Indicators Dataset, which contains 253,680 samples and 22 health-related features. The target variable (HeartDiseaseorAttack) is binary:

1: Person has heart disease
0: Person does not have heart disease

## Steps to Run the Code
1-Install the required libraries: tensorflow, numpy, pandas, sklearn, matplotlib, seaborn, keras-tuner.
2-Download the dataset (heart_disease_health_indicators.csv) and place it in your working directory.
3-Open the provided .ipynb file in Jupyter Notebook.
4-Run all cells to load the dataset, train the model, and evaluate the results.
5-Optionally, launch TensorBoard to visualize training logs.
